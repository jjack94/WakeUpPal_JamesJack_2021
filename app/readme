Wake Up Pal

This application uses the TimePicker class and Google Maps API

This app sets an alarm to go off at specified user time
There are two methods to do so:
    Clock view
    Analog selection
The Weather and Traffic page:
    -Displays current Android device location (must be added manually to emulator settings)
    -Shows current location with view of current traffic flow
    -Weather is displayed via Webview on Weather.com for Chicago Area
        -In order to change default display the URL must be altered in the Java class for WakeScreen
        -A full page Chrome tab is opened if the webview elements are clicked on
The map location does not allow the use of custom routes for traffic at this time
